1. vi cv (then wrote text).

2. a. key:j or enter->		Move the cursor down one line at time.
   b. key:k->			Move the cursor up one line at time.
   c. key:/age or ?age->	Search for word age
   d. key:   :5->		Step to line 5 (assuming that you are in line 1 and file is more than 5 lines).
   e. key:dd			Delete the line you are on and line 5.
   f. key:A			How to step to the end of line and change to writing mode in one-step.


3. List the available shells in your system.

cat /etc/shells

4. List the environment variables in your current shell.

env or printenv

5. List all of the environment variables for the bash shll.

man bash (then go to page 770, you will find all the env variables defined here)

6. What are the commands that list the value of a specific variable?

a regular variable ---> echo $varaible_name
an env variable    ---> echo $ENV_VARIABLE   or  printenv VARIABLE_NAME

7. Display your current shell name.

echo $SHELL

8. State the initialization files of: sh, ksh, bash.

bash: 1) Global files:  shell startup files that store configurations for all users on the system and these include:
		1- /etc/profile (use cat to view it),  it stores system-wide environment configurations and startup programs for login setup.
                    All configurations that you want to apply to all system users’ environments should be added in this file.
      2) User spesific files: bash startup dot files, that store configurations for a particular user on the system,
         they are located in a user’s home directory and they include:
		1-  ~/bash.profile (use cat to view its content) this stores user specific environment and startup programs configurations.
 		    You can set your custom PATH environment variable here.
		2- ~/.bashrc file (use cat to view its content) this file stores user specific aliases and functions.


9. Edit in your profile to display date at login and change your prompt permanently. (My default prompt [ahmed@localhost ~]$)

vi ~/.bashrc
  then inside the file we add:(under: # User specific aliases and functions)
date
PS1="MyTestPrompt>>> "


10. Execute the following command :
	echo \ then press enter
    What is the purpose of \ ?

    It allows to me echo multi line. Ex: echo \ 
    >'a
    >b
    >c'
    the output is a
		  b
		  c

	OR

    it's an escape charecter. for example to echo the follwing: Hello "ahmed", I have to write:
	echo "hello \"ahmed\""

    Notice the prompt ”>” what is that? and how can you change it from “>” to “:”?

	by changing the PS2 value in the bashrc file. Ex: under '# User specific aliases and functions' add:
		PS2=":"
        save the file and quit. You will find the cursor updated from > to :.

11. Create a Bash shell alias named ls for the “ls –l” command.

alias ls='ls -l'  (will be lost once you close the terminal)
