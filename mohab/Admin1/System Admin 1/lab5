3. Backup /etc directory using tar utility.

tar -cvf lab_5_files/etc_bak.tar /etc (note that the source is relative, not absolute)

4. Starting from your home directory, find all files that were modified in the last two day.

find / -mtime 2 2> /dev/null

5. Starting from /etc, find files owned by root user.

find /etc -user root

6. Find all directories in your home directory.

find /home/ahmed -type d 2> /dev/null

7. Write a command to search for all files on the system that, its name is “.profile”.

find / -name .bashrc 2> /dev/null

8. Identify the file types of the following: /etc/passwd, /dev/pts/0, /etc, /dev/sda

file /etc/passwd     ---> Ascii text
file /dev/pts/0	     ---> character special (136/0)
file /etc            ---> directory
file /dev/sda        ---> block special (8/0)

9. List the inode numbers of /, /etc, /etc/hosts.

file /            ---> directory  	so  ls -id /           ---> 128
file /etc         ---> directory        so  ls -id /etc        ---> 268583041
file /etc/hosts   ---> Ascii text file  so  ls -i /etc/hosts   ---> 268593327

10. Copy /etc/passwd to your home directory, use the commands diff and cmp, and Edit in the file you copied, and then use these commands again, and check the output.

cp /etc/passwd /home/ahmed/passwd_cpy
vi /home/ahmed/passwd_cpy  (then added 3 lines: foo, bar and baz)
diff /etc/passwd /home/ahmed/passwd_cpy
59a60,62
> foo
> bar
> baz

11. Create a symbolic link of /etc/passwd in /boot.

sudo ln -s /etc/passwd /boot/passwd_link

12. Create a hard link of /etc/passwd in /boot. Could you? Why?

sudo ln /etc/passwd /boot/passwd_link_hard
No, I couldn't. because they are two different partitions. (to know your partitionss, use 'cat /etc/fstab ')
