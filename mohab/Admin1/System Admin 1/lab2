1. Create a user account with the following attribute:
	-username: islam
	-Fullname/comment: Islam Askar
	-Password: islam (Note that this password is weak)

sudo useradd -c "Islam Askar" -md "/home/islam" islam
sudo passwd islam

2. Create a user account with the following attribute
 	-Username: baduser
	-Full name/comment: Bad User
	-Password: baduser

sudo useradd -c "Bad User" -md "/home/baduser" baduser
sudo passwd baduser

3. Create a supplementary (Secondary) group called pgroup with group ID of 30000.

sudo groupadd -g30000 pgroup

4. Create a supplementary group called badgroup.

sudo groupadd badgroup
Note that it took an id of 30001 (I checked using tail -3 /etc/group)

5. Add islam user to the pgroup group as a supplementary group.

sudo usermod -aG pgroup islam
checked that it has been added sucessfully using tail -3 /etc/group

6. Modify the password of islam's account to password.

sudo passwd islam 

7. Modify islam's account so the password expires after 30 days (as of solving the problem, the date is 2020-11-16).

sudo chage -E 2020-12-16 islam

8. Lock bad user account so he can't log in.

sudo usermod -L baduser
when I tried 'su - baduser' and typed the password, it gave me authorization failure.

9. Delete bad user account.

sudo userdel baduser
I checked it was deleted by typing 'tail -3 /etc/passwd'

10. Delete the supplementary group called badgroup.

sudo groupdel badgroup
I checked it was deleted by typing 'tail -3 /etc/group'


13) mkdir myteam
    sudo chmod u=r myteam  or sudo chmod u=r,g=---,o=--- myteam

14) su - islam
    exit

15) cd myteam
    bash: cd: myteam: Permission denied (because I changed to read only in question 13)

16) 1) chmod u=rw,g=wx,o=x oldpasswd
       chmod 631 oldpasswd
    2) umask 146 (note that a file will not have excution rights, to that we must type chmod a+x file_name)

    3) a file can have a max of 6 (read, write)
       a directory can have max 7 (read, write, excute)

    4) umask 777

17) 1) (coping directory) source->r-x , directory->-wx
    2) (coping file) source->r-- , directory->-wx
    3) (delete a file) --- (deleteing a file requries no permissions at all)
    4) (changing a directory) --x
    5) (listing a directory) r--
    6) (view file content) r--
    7) (modifing a file's content) -w- 
    
18) touch 444file
    chmod 444 444file
    rm 444file (can't be removed, admin can remove it though)
    vi 444file (will open in read only, so it can't be editted) 

19) x (excute) for file means it's runnable (like a c, java or python file)
    x (excute) for directory means it can be opened
