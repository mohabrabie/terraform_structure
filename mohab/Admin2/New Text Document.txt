1) /boot/grub2/grub.cfg   (don't edit)   ---> Grub2 (boot loader) config files 
2) /etc/default/grub ---> Grub2 menu config files
	run grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg    if you edit Grub2 menu
3) /boot  ---> contains 'vmlinuz' 
4) /etc/systemd/system/default.target (link to: /usr/lib/systemd/system/multiuser.target)
	---> that file is read by systemd to determine the default system target (runlevel)
5) /etc/cups/cupsd.conf   --->   contains configuration data about the CUPS daemon (Common UNIX Printing System).
6) /etc/cups/printers.conf file  ---> contains configuration data about the printers
7) /etc/at.allow and /etc/at.deny files ---> restrict or allow users to run the at command.
8) /var/spool/cron/{user} ---> contains crontab files (avoid modifing them, instead use crontab –e command)
	format: Min(0-59) Hours(0-23)Day(1-31) Month(1-12)Day(0-6) Command
	ex: 30 6 * * 0 /home/aya/mys1.sh
9) /etc/anacrontab   ---> automates the execution of system tasks.
10) /etc/rsyslog.conf file  ---> configuration file for 'rsyslog' cmd.
	– Selector
		• Facility: category of system processes that
			generate the messages
			– Example: kern, mail, daemon, cron, local0-7, *, ...
		• Level: severity or importance of the message
			– Example: emerg, alert, crit, err, warning,...
	– Action: where to send a message
		• Example: /pathname, @hostname, username, *
		– /pathname must already be exist
11) Log files:
--------------
	/var/log/dmesg    ---> contains messages from the kernel that were generated during the boot process.
	/var/log/messages  ---> contains messages from most of your system’s services.
	/var/log/maillog
	/var/log/secure   ---> contains messages and errors from securityrelated services such as login,
			network connections. Can be used to detect unauthorized logins (access).
12) /etc/logwatch/conf/logwatch.conf  ---> Used to configure 'logwatch' utility. Note that logwatch must be installe first.

			-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) /lib/modules/<kernel-version> directory   ---> holds the kernal modules
2) /lib/modules/<kernelversion>/modules.dep  ---> defines the module dependencies generated by 'depmod' cmd,
	Note that you rarely need to use the 'depmod' cmd, because /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit script is configured to run the
	'depmod' command when the system is booted.
3) /etc/modprobe.conf configuration file is consulted for appropriate default values when the cmd 'modprobe' is used.
4) /etc/sysctl.conf   ---> holds kernel configuration file 
5) /etc/fstab  ---> contains mounted file system (partitions)
	remember rc.sysinit scripts (/etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit), that script checks /etc/fstab for mounted drives.

The /etc/passwd file ---> username:x:uid:gid:comment:home-directory:login-shell
							1	   2   3   4   5          6              7
							
The /etc/shadow file    ---> username:encrypted passwd:last changed:min:max:warn:inactive:expire:future-use

	1) Username : It is your login name.
	2) Password : It is your encrypted password. The password should be minimum 8-12 characters long including special characters, digits, lower case alphabetic and more.
		Usually password format is set to $id$salt$hashed, The $id is the algorithm used On GNU/Linux as follows:
	3) Last password change (lastchanged) : Days since Jan 1, 1970 that password was last changed
	4) Minimum : The minimum number of days required between password changes i.e. the number of days left before the user is allowed to change his/her password
	5) Maximum : The maximum number of days the password is valid (after that user is forced to change his/her password)
	6) Warn : The number of days before password is to expire that user is warned that his/her password must be changed
	7) Inactive : The number of days after password expires that account is disabled
	8) Expire : days since Jan 1, 1970 that account is disabled i.e. an absolute date specifying when the login may no longer be used.
	9) future-use : reserved for future use
	
The /etc/group file ---> groupname:x:gid:comma-separated list of group members

The /etc/gshadow file ---> file is readable only by the root user and contains an encrypted password for each group,
							as well as group membership and administrator information.
							
	1) Group name — The name of the group. Used by various utility programs as a human-readable identifier for the group.
	2) Encrypted password — The encrypted password for the group. If set,
		non-members of the group can join the group by typing the password for that group using the newgrp command. If the value of this field is !,
		then no user is allowed to access the group using the newgrp command. A value of !! is treated the same as a value of ! — however,
		it also indicates that a password has never been set before. If the value is null, only group members can log into the group.
	3) Group administrators — Group members listed here (in a comma delimited list) can add or remove group members using the gpasswd command.
	4) Group members — Group members listed here (in a comma delimited list) are regular, non-administrative members of the group.
	
	
2) /etc/skel   ---> skel stands for (skelton)
					only admin can manage that directory
					contains all the files and directories which are automatically copied to the newly created user’s home directory.
		-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		
1) /etc/sysconfig/network   ---->  contains global network configuration	
2) /home/quota.user   ---> stores quota information about user
