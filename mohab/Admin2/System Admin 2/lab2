1- Check the present value of /proc/sys/net/ipv4/icmp_echo_ignore_all

cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/icmp_echo_ignore_all
value is 0

2- It should be 0, change it to 1 which will prevent other hosts from successfully pinging your host while not affecting your ability to ping them.

sudo su - root
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/icmp_echo_ignore_all

3-  Try to ping your colleague, let your colleague try to ping your host.

ping is disabled duo to the above step.

4- Reboot and try the last step. What happened? Why?

Now it pings because the changes made in question 2 are reset when system reboots.

5- Edit /etc/sysctl.conf and put the following line at the bottom: net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_all=1

vi /etc/sysctl.conf   ------------> then we add at the end of the file: net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_all=1

6- Execute sysctl –p command.

sysctl –p
after executing the above cmd, the pinging will be disabled even if the machine reboots.

7- Check the value of /proc/sys/net/ipv4/icmp_echo_ignore_all.

cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/icmp_echo_ignore_all
value is 1  (duo to the edit done in question 5)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
8- Use fdisk -l to locate information about the partition sizes.

fdisk -l

9- Use fdisk to add a new logical partition that is 1GB in size.

fdisk /dev/sdc
n
l
enter
+1G
w

10-  Did the kernel feel the changes? Display the content of /proc/partitions file? What did you notice? How to overcome that?

cat /proc/partitions 
partprobe


11-  Make a new ext2 file system on the new logical partition you just created. Bonus: Try creating the ext2 filesystem with 2k blocks and one inode per every 4k (two blocks) of filesystem.

fdisk /dev/sdc
n
l
enter
+1G
w
mkfs -t ext2 /dev/sdc1

12-  Create a directory, name it /data.

mkdir /data

13-  Add a label to the new filesystem, name it data.

e2label /dev/sdc1 /data
mount LABEL=/dev/sdc1 /data1

14-  Add a new entry to /etc/fstab for the new filesystem using the label you just create.

vi /etc/fstab
/dev/sdc1/data ext2 default 0 0

15-  Mount the new filesystem.

mount /dev/sdc1 /data	


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
16-  Display your swap size.

swapon -s

or

free -h

17- Create a swap file of size 512MB.

fdisk /dev/sdc
n
l
enter
+1G
t (changing the file type)
82
w

18- Add the swap file to the virtual memory of the system.

mkswap /dev/sdc1
swapon /dev/sdc1
swapon -s   <to verify>

19-  Display the swap size

swapon -s
Note I deleted it with: swapoff /dev/sdc1
